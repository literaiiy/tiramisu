# 🍰 Tiramisu: Name History and Hypixel Stats Analysis ☕
tiramisu.cc, or Tiramisu, is a player statistics site that intertwines the Mojang and Hypixel APIs, while giving a detailed analysis on your Hypixel statistics. There are many improvements over sk1er.club and plancke.io that were designed specifically to compete with those websites.

This is a private repository containing the source code for the project solely for backup purposes. This code may be released for the open-source community once the project hits a certain milestone in popularity.

If you are here and not me, how? How is that even possible?

# About literaiiy
Hello! I am literaiiy (styled lowercase), a high-school student in the San Francisco Bay Area. I am fascinated with technology, especially smartphones and other mobile devices, older personal and datacenter computer components, as well as circuit board electronics. I have years of experience in the Microsoft Office and Adobe Creative Cloud suites.

literaiiy is a pseudonym I adopted in March of 2018, as an intentionally incorrectly spelt version of the word literally- although a word that has a simple definition, is also a word that most people cannot use correctly- a common word that has dulled due to overuse. 


# FAQ

**How is your site different from NameMC, Plancke's site, or Sk1er's site?**
- While those sites do either name history or Hypixel player stats, Tiramisu aims to cover both in an efficient and non-cluttered way. Some things I might do better or worse. Large amount of respect goes to those three sites and their developers, as they were a huge inspiration for this project!

**What is a UUID?**
- A UUID, or Universally Unique IDentifier, is a unique hexadecimal value that is tied directly to a Minecraft account. Your UUID is persistently attatched to your Minecraft account, which is why it is better for tying statistics to an account.

**Will you ever put ads?**
- No. Tiramisu is ad-free and plans to never change that. I am fully supported by donations, which go directly to me and are recycled back into working on Tiramisu.

**Are you stealing my data?**
- Also- no. This is covered in the privacy policy. I don't take any data, whether that is personally identifiable or agreggate data (statistics based on your search history, where you go, etc.)

**Why don't you have (this feature)?**
- Tiramisu is a relatively new project. Most major features will be added soon as Tiramisu is under active development, but if you have a special request, feel free to contact me on Twitter.

**Why did you name your site Tiramisu?**
- Some shit about the dessert

**Do you work alone?**
- Yes. I develop Tiramisu independently, and as a side project amongst schoo.

**Is Tiramisu open-source?**
- Not at the moment.

**Why is there a '>' symbol in front of my first name's duration?**
- Mojang doesn't provide an account's creation date in the API, so I used the account's Hypixel join date, instead, if it was before their first name change. This means that number is most likely not an accurate figure, but it is definitely more than whatever is listed there.

**What is the "Hypixel ____" on my profile?**
This Hypixel seniority index I created is entirely based on how long you have been playing on the server- or more accurately, the amount of time since your first login. There are nine ranks, of which are based on the formula ![equation]("https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?y=12(log(x&plus;1)"), where `x` is the amount, in years, required to achieve the `y`th rank.

**Why don't the player counts instantly update every time I refresh?**
They only update once every 15 seconds to avoid spam and going over the API's rate limit of 120 requests per minute.

**How old are you?**
- 470\. Give or take a few hundred years.
